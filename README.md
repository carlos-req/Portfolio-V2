This project has helped me showcase my React skills as well as other projects that I have worked on. I learned a lot of things with this project such as how to use components, how to take advantage of tailwind CSS to make my page fully responsive and how to create a fully functional a single page web application. To see project on local computer, use ##npm run dev
